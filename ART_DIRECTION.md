# MathSkillz Art Direction

## Project Vision
Create an exciting, collectible, battle-based maths adventure for Henry Gilmore (Year 4, NZ curriculum) that feels like:
- **Pokemon** (creatures, battles, progression),
- **Ninjago** (hero growth, elemental powers, belts),
- **Minecraft** (pixel charm, crafted world, readable UI).

The experience should feel rewarding every 20–40 seconds, with clear learning feedback and strong “play again” motivation.

## Audience & Tone
- **Primary player:** Henry (Year 4).
- **Secondary audience:** parent/teacher reviewing progress.
- **Tone:** encouraging, adventurous, playful, never punishing.
- **Voice:** “You are growing stronger” + “You are getting smarter.”

## Core Creative Pillars
1. **Math is Hero Training**  
   Every question is a move in battle or a step toward mastery.
2. **Fast Reward Rhythm**  
   Frequent micro-rewards: XP pops, combo callouts, streak banners, unlocks.
3. **Readable at a Glance**  
   Big type, high contrast, low cognitive friction.
4. **Personal Journey**  
   Henry-centric praise, milestone moments, visible long-term progression.

## Visual Style
### Art Language
- Pixel-inspired UI framing with modern polish.
- High-energy gradients for magic/power moments.
- Chunky iconography and strong silhouettes.
- Friendly creature expressions over scary designs.

### Color System
- **Base UI:** deep navy/charcoal for focus.
- **Success:** bright green/cyan.
- **Warning/time:** amber/orange.
- **Error/damage:** warm red (short pulses only).
- **Mastery/rare:** gold + violet accents.

### Typography
- Large, rounded, game-like headers.
- Highly legible body text.
- Numerical answers prioritized with strongest contrast.

## World Identity (Curriculum Strands)
Each maths strand has a distinct biome + VFX signature:
- **Number:** Electric City (blue/yellow sparks)
- **Algebra:** Gear Forge (orange/iron glow)
- **Measurement:** Clockwork Harbor (teal/water shimmer)
- **Geometry:** Crystal Temple (purple/prism shine)
- **Statistics:** Data Jungle (green pulse + scan lines)

## Character & Creature Direction
- Creatures should be cute-first, element-themed, and color-coded to worlds.
- Henry’s progression represented by:
  - level,
  - belt rank,
  - elemental charge/power aura,
  - unlockable “title” moments.

## UX & Feedback Direction
### Positive Feedback
- Correct answer: punchy hit + particle burst + XP popup.
- Combo thresholds (3x/5x/8x): short celebratory callouts.
- Mastery completion: badge card + world glow transition.

### Corrective Feedback
- Keep wrong-answer feedback brief and kind.
- Provide confidence-preserving language (“Try again, ninja!”).
- Highlight learning opportunity, not failure.

### Accessibility
- Keep min contrast high for text/buttons.
- Ensure color is never the only signal (add icon/text).
- Large tap targets for touch devices.

## Animation & Motion
- Use short, snappy timings (150–350ms) for UI interactions.
- Battle impacts: tiny screen shake + hit-stop feel.
- Reward moments: upward motion + scale pop.
- Avoid long animations that block answer flow.

## Audio Direction
- Chiptune-meets-adventure tone.
- Distinct SFX families:
  - answer correct,
  - answer wrong (soft),
  - level up,
  - belt up,
  - creature unlock,
  - boss warning.
- Keep clips short, satisfying, and non-fatiguing.

## Reward Economy Presentation
- Clearly display XP, streak, combo, and progress in one glance.
- Use visible “next unlock” hints to drive replay.
- Frame curriculum completion as world-saving progress.

## Content Voice Examples
- “Great strike, Henry! +12 XP”
- “Combo rising! Ninja focus unlocked!”
- “World mastered: Geometry Crystal Temple complete!”
- “You’re one battle away from your next belt.”

## Production Priorities (Creative)
1. Strengthen strand biome identity in map and battle UI.
2. Add combo milestone overlays and richer victory cards.
3. Expand creature roster with theme-consistent variants.
4. Add short boss intros/outros for major milestones.
5. Add weekly quest visual track for replay motivation.

## Quality Bar Checklist
- Is the screen instantly readable for a Year 4 player?
- Does every 30 seconds include a meaningful feedback/reward moment?
- Does success feel exciting without being visually noisy?
- Is the learning objective always clear?
- Does Henry feel like the hero of a progressing journey?
- Can the game be played on Henry's mum's phone, as well as the family laptop?
